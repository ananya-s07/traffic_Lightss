# traffic_Lightss
Developed a multithreaded traffic light simulation using modern C++. Implemented a state machine to manage traffic signal transitions with configurable timing. Used atomic variables and thread synchronization to ensure safe inter-thread communication and graceful shutdown. Demonstrates real-time system behavior and concurrency control.
